# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on building a Node.js/Express for the WTWR application that connects to MongoDB, defines user and clothing-item schemas with validation, implements the required CRUD and like/unlike routes, and handles errors according to the spec. I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing,deploy web applications on a remote machine to create a server with an API and user authorization. I distinguished between authentication, authorization and identification.

the project structure is set up with controllers, models, routes, utils, and configuration files, connected to the database, defined schemas with proper validation (including enums and URLs), and implemented all the required endpoints with middleware to inject a user ID.
